      This policy applies to purchases made directly at SpellRightPro using Stripe.

    <h2>Subscriptions are Non-Refundable</h2>
    <p>
      All subscription payments (monthly and annual) are <strong>non-refundable</strong> and
      <strong>non-prorated</strong> once a billing period begins, to the fullest extent permitted by law.
      Cancelling a subscription stops future renewals; you’ll continue to have access until the end of the
      current billing period.
    </p>

    <h2>Annual Plan</h2>
    <p>
      Annual subscriptions are charged up front and are <strong>not eligible for refunds</strong>, including
      partial refunds for unused time, after the charge has been captured.
    </p>

    <h2>Free Trials & Promotions</h2>
    <p>
      If a free trial is offered, you won’t be charged until the trial ends. To avoid charges, cancel before the
      trial period expires. Once the trial converts to a paid subscription, charges are non-refundable.
    </p>

    <h2>Duplicate/Unauthorized Charges</h2>
    <p>
      If you believe you were charged in error (e.g., duplicate transaction or unauthorized use), please
      <a href="/contact">contact support</a> within 7 days and include your account email, charge date, and amount.
      We’ll investigate and correct any processing mistakes as required by applicable law.
    </p>

    <h2>How to Cancel</h2>
    <p>
      You can cancel at any time from your account’s billing section (or by requesting a cancellation via
      <a href="/contact">support</a>). Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing period.
    </p>

    <h2>Legal</h2>
    <p>
      Nothing in this policy limits rights that cannot be waived under applicable consumer laws. Where required
      by law, we will provide appropriate remedies.
